In early 2014, a Latvian hacker got into Yahoo's database. From the article I found on 'https://www.csoonline.com/article/3180762/inside-the-russian-hack-of-yahoo-how-they-did-it.html', the hacker was hired by Russian agents, but it did not give a motivation behind the hack. It seems a careless Yahoo employee clicked on a link sent by the hacker in a spear-phishing email, which granted him access. The "tech flaw" here was apparently human error.

One of the first things the hacker did was install a back door onto the server so that he could access it later. 
He managed to get many "names, phone numbers, password challenge questions and answers and, crucially, password recovery emails and a cryptographic value unique to each account." 
Then he and a partner put an access cookie generator on the server, which affected Yahoo users throughout 2015 and 2016. They sifted through the recovery emails to identify users who were affiliated with companies or organizations of interest.

In response to this breach, Yahoo did the following:
-Yahoo required potentially affected users to change their passwords.
-Yahoo also required all other users who had not changed their passwords since the time of the theft to do so.
-Yahoo invalidated unencrypted security questions and answers so they cannot be used to access an account.

So, it seems like they didn't do much... but I bet they also fired that employee who clicked the link in the hacker's email.
