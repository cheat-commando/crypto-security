my cipher scrambles the characters of a string. The code is in the part 2 folder.

The key is a word, not a number, and it can be basically any word you want, but it works better if it is a longer word. It MUST have at least one consonant and two vowels.

(ALSO!! I just discovered this thing is not glitch-proof. When copying the encoded message into the decoder, use the console log instead of the text on the web page. I will work on fixing that!)
